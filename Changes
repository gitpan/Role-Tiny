  - Remove redundant code in create_class_with_roles

  - Split Role::Tiny out into its own dist

Changes below this line are from when Role::Tiny was still bundled with Moo:

  - Fix a bug where coercions weren't called on lazy default/builder returns
  - Switch Moo::Utils to using Module::Runtime, and add the 5.8 %INC
    leakage fix into Role::Tiny's _load_module to provide partial parity
  - Update incompatibilities with Moose documentation
  - Remove Sub::Quote's outstanding queue since it doesn't actually slow
    things down to do it this way and makes debugging easier.
  - Revert 'local $@' around require calls to avoid triggering Unknown Error
  - Explicitly require Role::Tiny in Role::Tiny::With (RT#70446)
  - Fix spurious 'once' warnings under perl -w
